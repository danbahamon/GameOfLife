Hi, if you are reading this then I hope you enjoy seeing the Mold Mode I created for the game.
I recommend the following Settings for Mold Mode:

Map Size : 150 x 75
Edge Style: Wrap Around
View->Mold Mode = ON

This will run the game of life simulation but it will keep track of how long the cell has been alive to determine the color of the pixel
With Mold Mode on, you will see how the same simulation seems to come alive. I hope you enjoy it.
